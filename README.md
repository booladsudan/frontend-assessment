# Brief

This is my approach on the given frontend assessment.\
I have used TailwindCSS to style the pages/exercises.

Exercise 1 can be accessed in `/`

For exercise 2 I moved to `data.json` to a different file location. Exercise 2 can be accessed in `/exercise-2`

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Bonus exercise

Honestly I don't know the explanation all I know is that this `(+'a')` results to NaN
